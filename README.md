This repository contains my coursework and projects for the Full Stack Open 2022 course offered by the University of Helsinki. The course serves as an introduction to modern web application development with a focus on building single-page applications using ReactJS and REST APIs built with Node.js. The curriculum also includes a section on GraphQL, a modern alternative to REST APIs.
